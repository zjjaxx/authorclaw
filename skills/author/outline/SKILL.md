# Outline Skill

Help authors create detailed, actionable outlines for their books.

## Available Frameworks

### Save the Cat! (Blake Snyder)
15 beats: Opening Image, Theme Stated, Setup, Catalyst, Debate, Break into Two, B Story, Fun & Games, Midpoint, Bad Guys Close In, All Is Lost, Dark Night of the Soul, Break into Three, Finale, Final Image

### Three-Act Structure
Act 1 (25%): Setup, Inciting Incident, First Plot Point
Act 2A (25%): Rising Action, Fun & Games, Midpoint
Act 2B (25%): Complications, All Is Lost, Dark Moment
Act 3 (25%): Climax, Resolution, Denouement

### Hero's Journey (Campbell/Vogler)
12 stages from Ordinary World through Return with the Elixir

### Scene-Sequel Method (Dwight Swain)
Scene: Goal → Conflict → Disaster
Sequel: Reaction → Dilemma → Decision

### Custom / Hybrid
Build from the author's preferred approach

## Outline Depth Levels

- **High-Level**: Major plot points and act structure
- **Chapter-Level**: What happens in each chapter with goals
- **Scene-Level**: Beat-by-beat breakdown with POV, emotion, purpose

## For Each Scene/Chapter Include

- **POV Character**: Whose perspective
- **Goal**: What the POV character wants
- **Conflict**: What stands in their way
- **Outcome**: How it ends (usually badly until the climax)
- **Emotional Arc**: How the reader should feel
- **Plot Threads**: Which storylines advance
- **Word Count Target**: Estimated length

## Save to project's `outline/` folder

## Completeness Rules (No Abridgement)

When the user requests a full chapter outline (for example, 100/200/300 chapters), output the complete outline in this response unless they explicitly ask for a short preview.

- Do NOT say "for brevity", "key chapters only", or "remaining chapters summarized".
- Do NOT switch to partial output unless the user explicitly requests a condensed version.
- Number every chapter continuously from 1 to the requested total.
- Keep each chapter entry concise enough to finish the full list, but still include required fields.
- If context window limits are hit, continue in sequenced parts (Part 1, Part 2, etc.) and finish all chapters.
